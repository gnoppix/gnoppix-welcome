<big>Handling hardware</big>

Gnoppix Linux not only supports the use of multiple kernels (selectable from the advanced options at the boot screen), but also provides access to the very latest bleeding-edge kernels as well. This can be done through the use of the Kernel module in Gnoppix Linux's graphical Settings Manager, or via the command line using the chwd-kernel (Gnoppix Linux Hardware Detection) command.

These Gnoppix Linux tools will automatically update a newly installed kernel along with any modules currently in use with your existing kernel. For example, if you were to update from kernel 3.18 to 4.1, chwd-kernel would automatically include the kernel 4.1 builds and all modules used with kernel 3.18. How about that!

You can configure your hardware through the Hardware Detection module in the Settings Manager or alternatively with the chwd cli-application. With these tools, you can install for example graphical drivers, free and proprietary.

<big>Getting help</big>

Although Gnoppix Linux is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, we don't claim it's perfect. There can be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more, or just want to personalize it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!

<b>Search the web</b>

Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favorite search engine. Just include words like 'Linux', 'Gnoppix Linux' or 'Arch' in your search query.

As Gnoppix Linux is based on Arch Linux, guides and tips designed for Arch usually apply to Gnoppix Linux too.

<b>Look in the forums</b>

For specific help with Gnoppix Linux we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!

The Gnoppix Linux forum is divided into sub-forums for different topics and environments, please post your query in the appropriate place!
